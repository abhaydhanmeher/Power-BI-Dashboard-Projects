# Power-BI-Dashboard-Projects On Healthcare 
# Introduction: 
The Healthcare Data Analysis Dashboard on Power BI provides a comprehensive review of patient health data from 2019 to 2023. This report is organized into two primary sections — "Patient Demographics" and "Clinical Insights" — and employs visualizations along with DAX calculations to highlight essential trends and key performance indicators (KPIs). This enables healthcare professionals to make well-informed decisions and enhance patient care strategies.

# Data Collection: 
The dataset includes a variety of attributes such as patient demographics, medical conditions, admission details, and more. It is a synthetic dataset intended for educational and non-commercial purposes, ensuring privacy and compliance. Data cleaning is performed using Microsoft Excel, eliminating incomplete records and irrelevant columns to improve the accuracy of the analysis.

# Data Preparation for Analysis using Power BI:
* Creating Separate Tables: A Date table is created to support temporal analysis, which is linked to the main dataset. Furthermore, a "Calculations" table is established for KPI measures.
* Creating Calculated Columns: New calculated columns like Age Buckets, Readmission Indicator, and Total Stay Duration are developed to aid in analysis and visualization.
* Creating Measurements for KPIs: Various KPIs are computed using DAX expressions, including Readmission Count, Readmission Rate, and other relevant metrics.

# Analysis and Visualizations for the Report: 
The report is divided into two sections for better clarity:

1. Patients Demographics:

Offers insights into the demographics of the patient population, such as age distribution, gender distribution, and common medical conditions.
Delivers actionable insights for customizing care strategies for specific patient groups, optimizing resource allocation, and enhancing overall patient satisfaction.

2. Clinical Insights:

Reveals significant medical trends and insights,
